# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction
Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using Federated Learning

Dataset :- 
We collected dataset from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database.
https://adni.loni.usc.edu/study-design/

Dataset is divided into 4 parts 
1.AD(Alzheimer's Disease)
2.CN(Cognitively Normal)
3.LMCI(Late Mild Cognitive Impairment)
4.EMCI(Early Mild Cognitive Impairment)
After downloading this dataset

Go and run Client(1).pynb and Client(2).pynb both file at same time on Jupyter notebook in that file all preprocessing and connection to server file and model implementation is done.

Then run server file then it will start running multiple client data on same model and send model with higher accuracy.
More Clients   -----> More Data --------> More data for training  -------> More Accurate Model it will be ......
